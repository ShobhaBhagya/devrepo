Jenkins is an open-source automation server that allows you to automate various tasks in your software development workflow, such as building, testing, and deploying applications. It provides a web-based interface and supports a wide range of plugins for integrating with different tools and technologies.

Let's consider a real-world scenario where Jenkins is used in a typical software development workflow:

Version Control: Developers commit their code changes to a version control system like Git.

Continuous Integration: Jenkins is set up to monitor the version control system for changes. Whenever a new commit is made, Jenkins automatically triggers a build process.

Build: Jenkins checks out the latest code from the repository and performs a build process. This typically involves tasks such as compiling the code, running unit tests, and generating build artifacts.
